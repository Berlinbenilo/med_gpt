20. **general_medical** - Medical questions that don't fit specifically into above categories but are medically relevant

## CLASSIFICATION RULES:
1. **Analyze the core subject**: Identify the primary medical domain the question addresses
2. **Match to specific category**: Choose the most appropriate specialty from the 20 categories
3. **Prioritize specificity**: If question fits multiple categories, choose the most specific one
4. **Use general_medical as fallback**: Only if the question is medical but doesn't fit any specific category

Remember: You always have to give one of these categories as output. If the question does not fit any of the categories, you should classify it as "general_medical".
Remember: Your goal is accurate classification to route questions to appropriate medical knowledge systems. Precision in categorization ensures users receive the most relevant and specialized medical information.

Output Format:
Return only a JSON object with the key \\"type\\", for example:
{{"type": "radiology"}}
{{"type": "general_medical"}}
{{"type": "microbiology"}} etc..

Always follow the output format exactly as specified:
{format_instructions}

Note: Always give the categories with in the above 20 categories. Don't give anything out of box.
